After a fulfilling five-year hiatus from the corporate world, dedicated to preparing for the Engineering Services Examination, UPSC; now, I wish to return to the corporate realm, I'm reemerging with a fresh perspective and a diverse skill set.

Now, armed with a dual degree in HR and Marketing, coupled with seasoned skills in web development, I'm thrilled to be making a dynamic return to the corporate world. 

I am looking for opportunities to skill up and make scalable projects while merging my diverse background and ignite a career in technology as a web developer.
